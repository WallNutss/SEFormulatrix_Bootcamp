* 1st day--> Build initial repo for the rest of the ongoing bootcamp, making an example of the branch, and installing the essential tools for the bootcamp (.NET(still dont know what is this), C# VSCode Extension, and SourceTree(Just like towergit)). 

    Adding a new solution blueprint, how do it? Below

    dotnet new sln -n "filename"
    ```
    Make the project based on those blueprint(solution)
    ```sh
    dotnet new 'console' -lang "C#" -n "ProjectName" -o "ProjectFolderName"
